# What is this plugin?
It's a simple plugin that makes picking up budding amethysts with silk touch a normal Minecraft mechanic.

# Features
- Lets players mine budding amethysts with any silk touch pickaxe.

Currently, there are no configuration options for the plugin, but we can add them later if there is interest in the project. The current version of the plugin was intentionally kept simple to reduce the likelihood of it breaking between different Minecraft versions.

# Setup:
- Download the jar file.
- Place the file into your server's plugin folder.
- Start the server and Enjoy!

### Tested + Working Versions:
  - âœ… Tested on 1.21.1
